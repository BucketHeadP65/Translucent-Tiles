Makes windows non-overlapping, by automatically minimizing a window when it gets covered by another window, and optionally restoring it when space becomes available again.

This is intended to keep the workspace clutter-free while maximizing screen real estate and retain the user in full control over window and workspace management, aiming to combine the efficiency of a tiling layout with the flexibility of freely positionable floating windows.

Note that this script is an extension to be run on top of KWin and not a standalone window manager, and will also not do any automatic tiling.

Overlap prevention will only take effect between toplevel windows and not e.g. hide a parent window when a dialog opens. By default, special windows not associated with any regular window such as panel popouts or KRunner will be ignored as well; this can be changed in the configuration.

By default, any window that has been automatically minimized will be automatically restored once the space above it is free again; this can be disabled in the configuration.
